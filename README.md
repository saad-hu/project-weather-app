## Description and Outcome
This project is a weather app build using [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api). 

Making this project, I learned alot about Asynchronous JS, Promises. It also helped to expand my knowledge on callbacks and when to avoid them. I also learned about CSS transitions while making this project.    

Build using vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
